Inputs
======

This page details all the configuration options per input. 

There are a few generic options for each input. 
- **enabled**: This turns the input on and off. 
- **store_all**: ignore the only store on matching rule.
- **module**: This is used internally by pastehunter.

Pastebin
------------
To use the pastebin API you need an API key. These need to be purchased and are almost always on some sort of offer!
https://pastebin.com/pro The API uses your IP to authenticate instead of a key. You will need to whitelist your IP at https://pastebin.com/api_scraping_faq

- **api_scrape**: The URL endpoint for the list of recent paste ids.
- **api_raw**: The URL endpoint for the raw paste.
- **paste_limit**: How many pasteids to fetch from the recent list. 
- **store_all**: Store all pastes regardless of a rule match.

Github Gists
---------------
Github has an API that can be used at no cost to query recent gists. There are two options here. 

- Without an access key - You will have a low rate limit.
- With an access key - You will have a higher rate limit. 

The unauthenticated option is not suitable for pastehunter running full time. 
To create your key visit https://github.com/settings/tokens

*YOU DO NOT NEED TO GIVE IT ANY ACCESS PERMISSIONS*

- **api_token**: The token you generated.
- **api_limit**: Rate limit to prevent being blocked.
- **store_all**: Store all pastes regardless of a rule match.
- **user_blacklist**: Do not process gists created by these usernames.
- **file_blacklist**: Do not process gists that match these filenames.


Slexy
---------

Slexy has some heavy rate limits on it. 

- **store_all**: Store all pastes regardless of a rule match.
- **api_scrape**: The URL endpoint for the list of recent pastes.
- **api_raw**: The URL endpoint for the raw paste.
- **api_view**: The URL enpoint to view the paste.


StackExchange
-------------

The same API is used to query them all. Similar to github there is a public API which has a reduced rate limit 
or an App API which has a higher cap. There is a cap on 10,000 requests per day per IP, so pulling all would be impractical.
