Installation
============

There are a few ways to install 



Local Installation
------------------

Pastehunter
^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to run the latest stable version grab the latest release from https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter/releases.
If you want to run the development version clone the repository or download the latest archive. 

Pastehunter has very few dependancies you can install all the python libraries using the requirements.txt file and ``sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
    
    
    

Yara
^^^^
Yara is the scanning engine that scans each paste. Use the official documentation to install yara and the python3 library. 
https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html#compiling-and-installing-yara

All yara rules are stored in the YaraRules directory. An index.yar file is created at run time that includes all additional yar files in this directory. 
To add or remove yara rules, simply add or remove the rule file from this directory. 



Elastic Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to use the elastic search output module you will need to install elastic search. Pastehunter has been tested with version 6.x of Elasticsearch.
To install follow the offical directions on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html.

You will also need the elasticsearch python library which can be installed using ``sudo pip3 install elasticsearch``.

Kibana

Kibana is the frontend search to Elasticsearch. If you have enabled the Elasticsearch module you probably want this. 
To install follow the offical directions on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/deb.html.
